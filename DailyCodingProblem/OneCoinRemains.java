 * Problem #124
 * This problem was asked by Microsoft.
 * 
 * You have n fair coins and you flip them all at the same time. Any that come up tails you set aside. 
 *  The ones that come up heads you flip again. 
 *      How many rounds do you expect to play before only one coin remains?
 * 
 * Write a function that, given n, returns the number of rounds you'd expect to play until one coin remains.
